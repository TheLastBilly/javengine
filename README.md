# Javengine
Just in case it wasn't odbvious, Java + Engine = Javengine. A software renderer built  in Java. 

## Why? 
I'm currently taking a Java class, so I figure I should practice with the languaje at some point. As to why pick a
software renderer out of all things? Well, I've been wanting to build one for a while now, so why not?

## How do I build it?
You'll need three things:
* Java 
* Ant
* Patience

This is literally my first project using Java, so don't expect this thing to run without issues, and that's assuming it even builds. 

If you got all the dependencies installed, type the following in your terminal:
```
ant run
```
